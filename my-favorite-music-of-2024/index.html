  <p>When I was growing up, my dad used to play Dave Brubeck in the car when he&rsquo;d come to pick me up from school on Wednesdays. In high-school, I was listening to Monstercat dubstep on YouTube. In my years as a student I listened to a bunch of electronic music on ad-blocked YouTube Music and started collecting CDs.</p>
<p>These days I still enjoy all of the above, but my flow for finding and listening to music has changed a lot. I primarily find music by browsing <a href="https://www.platomania.nl/store/id/10/">record stores</a> and roaming around places like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a> and <a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>. Something I was confronted with when browsing for music more and more, is that there&rsquo;s no singular place one can listen to it all.</p>
<p>So for me, the move to setting up my own music <a href="https://stupidplusplus.com/things/server/">server</a> made perfect sense to solve that problem. And now that recommendation algorithms and poor accessibility are out of the picture, I feel my interactions with music have gotten a lot more personal and direct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to a LOT of music this year and I excitedly present my favorite albums I listened to in 2024. All albums come with a one sentence review from my first listen.</p>
<p>Yay music! (/≧▽≦)/</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;A good breakcore. Consider me a freaked out child in the woods.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>

</ul></blockquote>
<p>The first Venetian Snares release I ever listened to was <em>&ldquo;Rossz Csillag Alatt Született                    &ldquo;</em>. I believe Detrimentalist is the antithesis to that album and actually a lot of other  releases by Aaron. Whereas other VSnare albums have more breathing room and reliance on theatrics, Detrimentalist is a full blast freight train through breakcore jungle texture, rhythm and Aaron f&amp;#$ery.</p>
<p>I sometimes almost feel bad for liking this release so much, especially for that reason. Detrimentalist is Dr. Snares&rsquo; vodka; uncomplicated, strong as a motherf$%&amp;er and gets me buzzed every fucking time.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;MAKE MORE MUSIC FUUUUCK&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>

</ul></blockquote>
<p>I LOVE strongly themed albums like <em>&ldquo;Mm.. Food&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Velocity : Design : Comfort&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Krankhaus&rdquo;</em> and such. Their setup eases the sensation of being transported into a curated sonic space. It&rsquo;s convenient that I also happen to like these project&rsquo;s sonic spaces of course, but regardless.</p>
<p>Fakevox is a texturally amazing, glitchy, poppy, catchy, perfect and plastic world that still feels very tangible. In my mind, this album is a part of that whole Shibuya Kei wave vibe. It&rsquo;s hilarious, SO PLAYFUL and just all allround amazing.</p>
<p>I want to date this album, I want to be this album and I&rsquo;m extremely upset that Plus-Tech released <em>&ldquo;CARTOOOM!&rdquo;</em> and f&amp;%$ed right off.</p>

<p>In short, this album sounds like that <a href="https://youtu.be/gPbVRpRgHso">Cybergoth Dance Party</a> video. I love its gnarly distorted drum machine and rave synth textures. I love the fact that every word spoken on it has this extreme French slurring to it.</p>
<p>I actually recently found this album for 4 bucks in the second hand section of my local record store that has (in my opinion, sorry Plato Utrecht) awful curation. Very surprised, lucky, YAY!!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a monster caffeine sugar rush.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;ITS SO FUCKING GOOD FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU DYLAN I CRY EVERY TIME &ldquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Puk, 01/05/2024</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it feels a bit hypocritical to put this project on this list because I did play a part in its release. But come the f&amp;*$ on, it is just that good! Wacko_ is so sonically rich, its narrative so beautifully crafted and its experience so tailored to be experienced. Its music, I cannot describe in any other way, than simply beautiful.</p>
<p>I feel that, unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve developed a bit of snobbiness towards music. I cannot bring myself to enjoy a lot of it for various reasons. Categorically among which is a lot of &ldquo;songwriter music&rdquo;. Often times it doesn&rsquo;t manage to grasp me. There are exceptions to the rule, this album of course and most powerfully so &ldquo;<em>InorOut</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That song has layers upon layers of sound, and while that  should speak to my tastes, that&rsquo;s not even why I love it. The words, the emotion that&rsquo;s packed in that song. It reliably manages to punch my heart and make me cry. God damn those two piano notes before all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>Dylan, I know that you don&rsquo;t know how to respond to things like this, but whenever I listen to this album, I&rsquo;m blown away. My creations feel insignificant in the grand scheme of Wacko_ and I find it surreal that someone as lovingly human as you could create something so divine as this.</p>
<p>Yeah, f*%$ you Dylan. Thank you, <strong>PLEASE</strong> make more music.</p>

<ul>
<li>Puk, 17/05/2024</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I love Mouse On Mars. While I still consider <em>&ldquo;Parastrophics&rdquo;</em> to be the best work produced by these silly juke-loving German peeps, I&rsquo;ve got to acknowledge how sickeningly good Live04 is.</p>
<p>I sometimes feel like there&rsquo;s two MOMs: The band with Dodo Nkishi and the duo without. Live04 concentrates the best of the former. From the very old synth-heavy space beats (<em>&ldquo;Diskdusk&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Frosch&rdquo;</em>), to the funky, way-too-deep synth-poppings (<em>&ldquo;Mine Is in Yours&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Wipe That Sound&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>When Dodo hits <em>&ldquo;Actionist Respoke&rdquo;</em> with the <em>&ldquo;IIIIIIIIII IS JUUUUUUST WHAT YOUUUU SAY YOUUU TOOOO&rdquo;</em> I cannot help but wriggle. Vielen dank.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just miss one, I&rsquo;ve been a huge Squarepusher fan for years now. I think I just believed I&rsquo;d listened to Tom&rsquo;s entire discography, but as it turns out I hadn&rsquo;t. Surprisingly this release had passed me by entirely, and the moment I realized that I immediately acquired the album and hit play.</p>
<p>After getting comfortable with Go Plastic I nearly consider it my favorite Squarepusher release, rivaling even my love for albums like Ultravisitor. It&rsquo;s such a brooding, unapologetically course album, marvelously interjected by beauties like <em>&ldquo;I Wish You Could Talk&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>This thing feels bright green.</p>

<ul>
<li>Puk, 02/07/2024</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>When Atari Teenage Riot hit it big by establishing Digital Hardcore as a popular genre, I feel it inspired a bunch of bands that were previously playing distorted-guitar-musics to hop on that train. One such case is THE MAD CAPSULE MARKETS; starting out as a Punk band, slowing mixing more electronic influences into their sound, culminating in this album.</p>
<p>010 is beautiful Digital Hardcore slop and hits my weak spot for Japanese people yelling.</p>

<h2 id="britpop-by-ag-cook">Britpop <em>by A.G. Cook</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;FUCK OFF HOW DOES AG JUST RELEASE A 2 HOUR ALBUM AND  HAVE IT BE THIS GOOD. FUUUUUUCk&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Puk, 02/07/2024</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Yeah exactly. How does Alexander Guy fucking Cook just consistently drop these projects that are the length of movies and still have them sound this good???</p>
<p>I loved 7G so it&rsquo;s no wonder that I&rsquo;d end up considering Britpop to be among the best of 2024. I think that Britpop and 7G share a lot of DNA, they&rsquo;re both resonant spaces whose earcandy drive me to insanity.</p>
<p>I know that this is completely false, but I like to imagine there&rsquo;s a few Brat rejects on this album. Tracks like &ldquo;<em>Britpop</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Lucifer</em>&rdquo; are more likely just excerpts of the sheer time Alex and Charli spend in studio together, making stuff, sweet.</p>
<p>When I look at this 100 minute album, I&rsquo;ve just got to ask, Guy: Is this all of it? I just know that on that lil MacBook and all of them hard drives you&rsquo;ve got scattered around there&rsquo;s like 10 more Britpops. I will one day get ahold of them, you cannot keep them from me.</p>
<p>Bewitched is the ultimate gender euphoria track. R.I.P Sophie. &lt;3</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to a ton of music this year. There&rsquo;s too much music that I loved listening to this year to list neatly. But here&rsquo;s a few more projects that banged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moshpit - Follow the Loser</li>
<li>Bygones - Spiritual Bankruptcy</li>
<li>Toyod Ine - popwasbroken!!!</li>
<li>JPEGMAFIA &amp; Danny Brown - Scaring The Hoes</li>
<li>Everyone Is Not Alive by Touch People</li>
<li>Skrillex - &ldquo;Gost EP&rdquo;</li>
<li>Freak Out Squares - Building Better Bombs</li>
<li>Robert Lippok - Open Close Open</li>
<li>M-Beat ft. General Levy - Incredible</li>
<li>Mouse On Mars - Dimensional People</li>
<li>DJ Warlord - Droom</li>
<li>MAD BREAKS Presents: Vocalobreak</li>
<li>MACINTOSH PLUS - Sick &amp; Panic</li>
<li>HONDALADY - 303</li>
<li>hitbox - GLOBAL AND OFFENSIVE</li>
<li>DALLJUB STEP CLUB - CHECK THE SHADOW</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to Ma3ke, Ties, Mikkel, Damian, Sytse, Dylan, Robin, Benji, Joran, Konnie, Vivian, Jørgen and whoever I forgot to mention for having great music taste and influencing mine. This year I really enjoyed making a bunch of music too. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch more projects in the works that didn&rsquo;t make it this year so be ready for that next year I guess.</p>
<p>Really look forward to the new Clipping album, seeing JPEGMAFIA, seeing Machine Girl next year and surely we&rsquo;ll finally get another Death Grips release.</p>
<p><em><img src="selfie.jpg" alt="Selfie"></em></p>
<p>Thank you people who make music. I hope to listen to a lot more next year.</p>
