#### Programmer and Game Developer :wave:

I'm Pelle, a Dutch Programmer and Game design student looking for an internship position in programming at Splash Damage. I'm aware you don't actively take interns but I'm here to shoot my shot.

I've developed for a number of (online) multiplayer titles and have developed and published many smaller titles either myself or in collaboration within teams of 3-8 people. Playing and making multiplayer games is something that really excites me. I want to reach beyond what I'm individually capable of, test and improve on my skills, work on bigger projects and on bigger teams. I believe that, given the opportunity, I could make some great contributions to Splash Damage's upcoming projects.

I'd love to meet with you and discuss any positions you have available. I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Pelle "Stupid++" Bruinsma



(PS. In 2018 I sent in a report on color based aim assistance in Dirty Bomb. The report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZ1ggFAXH40oZ4XZygzCP8VAoVJ9KYOOH1ogFpAhScQ/edit?usp=sharing). Doughball and Geekybaking handled my ticket at the time and handed this report to Kamu.)
